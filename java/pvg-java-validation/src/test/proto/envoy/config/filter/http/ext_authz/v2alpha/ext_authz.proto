//     <envoy_api_msg_service.auth.v2alpha.CheckRequest>`.
//  2. Raw HTTP Authorization server by passing the request headers to the service.

// External Authorization filter calls out to an upstream authorization server by passing the raw
// HTTP request headers to the server. This allows the authorization service to take a decision
// whether the request is authorized or not.
//
// A successful check allows the authorization service adding or overriding headers from the
// original request before dispatching it to the upstream. This is done by configuring which headers
// in the authorization response should be sent to the upstream. See *allowed_authorization_headers*
// below.
//
// A failed check will cause this filter to close the HTTP request with 403 (Forbidden),
// unless a different status code has been indicated by the authorization server via response
// headers.
//
// If an error happens during the checking process, two situations may occur depending on the
// filter's configuration:
//
//  1. When *failure_mode_allow* is true, traffic will be allowed in the presence of an error. This
//     includes any of the HTTP 5xx errors, or a communication failure between the filter and the
//     authorization server.
//  2. When *failure_mode_allow* is false, the filter will *always* return a *Forbidden response* to
//     the client. It will *not allow* traffic to the upstream in the presence of an error. This
//     includes any of the HTTP 5xx errors, or a communication failure between the filter and the
//     authorization server.
//
// Note that filter will produce stats on error. See *Statistics* at :ref:`configuration overview
// <config_http_filters_ext_authz>`.
