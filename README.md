üì£**_Update: The next generation of `protoc-gen-validate`, now called
[`protovalidate`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate), is available in beta for Golang, Python, Java, and C++!
We're hard at work on a TypeScript implementations as well. To learn more, check out
our [blog post][pv-announce]. We value your input in refining our products, so

`protovalidate` is a series of libraries designed to validate Protobuf messages at
runtime based on user-defined validation rules. Powered by Google's Common
Expression Language ([CEL][cel-spec]), it provides a
flexible and efficient foundation for defining and evaluating custom validation
rules. The primary goal of `protovalidate` is to help developers ensure data
consistency and integrity across the network without requiring generated code.

Runtime implementations of [`protovalidate`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate) can be found in their own repositories:

- Go: [`protovalidate-go`][pv-go] (beta release)
- C++: [`protovalidate-cc`][pv-cc] (beta release)
- Java: [`protovalidate-java`][pv-java] (beta release)
- Python: [`protovalidate-python`][pv-python] (beta release)
- TypeScript: `protovalidate-ts` (coming soon)
